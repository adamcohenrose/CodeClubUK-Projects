<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start a new Scratch project. Delete the cat by right clicking it and clicking Delete</li>
<li>Replace the background with outdoor/city-with-water</li>
<li>Use the <strong>new sprite from file</strong> button to add a Rocket sprite to the project (use the Resources/Rocket.png costume).</li>
<li>Make the rocket hide when the green flag is clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we want to make the rocket move towards the mouse when the mouse is clicked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a when space key pressed control block, and under this make the rocket appear and glide towards the mouse</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fireworks don’t tend to fly from side to side, so lets make sure it always glides towards the mouse from the bottom of the screen. Before we show the rocket, use the go to block tell it to move to below the bottom of the screen, but stay in the same place horizontally.</li>

<li>Finally, lets make this work by using the mouse button instead of the space bar. To do this, we can wrap our script in a <strong>forever if mouse down</strong>. Then swap the <strong>when space key pressed</strong> control block for <strong>when flag clicked</strong> and last but not least make sure the rocket is hidden when everything starts up.</li>

<section id="step-4-fixing-the-broadcast-bug" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 4: Fixing the Broadcast Bug</h1>
<p>Remember earlier we had a problem involving holding down the mouse button? This occurs because when the rocket broadcasts its explosion, it will immediately repeat the if loop and send out another explosion message, before the last one has finished displaying. In computing we often call such problems &quot;bugs&quot;.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-7" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>To fix this, we can replace the broadcast block with a broadcast and wait block. This way, the loop will not repeat until the explosion finishes exploding.</li>
</ul>
