<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> In this project you will design and create a game for you and your friends to play! You will need to think about its different parts and plan your ideas before you begin making it on Scratch. You can use ideas from past projects and Scratch cards to help you.</p>

<h2>STEP 1: Planning your game</h2>
<p>What is the aim of the game? (For example, the aim of Felix &amp; Herbert was to avoid getting caught by the cat.) It might help for you to think of as many ideas as you can then choose the best. You could brainstorm with a friend or work on your own. Write your ideas below and choose the best one.</p>
