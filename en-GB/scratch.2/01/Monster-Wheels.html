<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>To make a wheel appear to move, we want to <strong>rotate</strong> it by a small amount and<br /> move it by a small amount when<br /> we receive a <strong>movement broadcast</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="9afbdbe0ac51544b8ab7e3df31d33d614e14957e.png" alt="when I receive [moved left v]
change x by ((move speed) * (-1))
turn ccw (15) degrees

when I receive [moved right v]
change x by (move speed)
turn cw (15) degrees" /></p>
<ul>
<li>If you wanted, you could replace the<br /> values with variables like <code class="blockorange">move speed</code>, so you could control the speed in all<br /> directions from one place.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(Notice how we have to multiply moveSpeed by -1 to get the negative value?)</strong></p>
